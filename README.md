  mail: 'mail@filipesantoscorrea.com'
  phone: '+1-123-456-7890'
```


<br>


## SEO configuration

You should also adjust your sites meta data (important for SEO) before deploying your portfolio site. This can be done by adjusting the options in the `.env` (located in the root folder) file:

```js
#
# Site meta data (important for SEO)
#
VUE_APP_TITLE = "Your site title..."
VUE_APP_DESCRIPTION = "Your site description..."
VUE_APP_NAME = "Your site name..."
VUE_APP_CANONICAL_SITE = "https://..."
```


<br>


## Create your own theme

You can also create your own individual theme. Just open the `./src/styles/themes.css` file and create a new CSS class e.g. `.rainbow`. Next, copy the contents of an already existing theme and paste it inside of your newly created CSS class `.rainbow`. Now you can adjust the settings of your theme (colors and font options) to fit your needs. Finally, open the `./src/config/setup.yml` and load your new theme `rainbow` by adjusting the `theme` parameter.

PS: I'm very happy to receive pull requests with new themes ðŸ¤—


<br>


## Install new fonts

You may also install new additional fonts that you desire. To do so, create a new folder under `./public/assets/fonts/` and copy your font  there. Next, create a css font-face by adjusting the `./src/styles/typography.css` file. Last but not least use your newly installed font in your theme.

One service which I highly recommend using when using Google Fonts is the [google-webfonts-helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts). The _google-webfonts-helper_ site help you to download all files of a selected font and also generated the CSS `@font-face`.
