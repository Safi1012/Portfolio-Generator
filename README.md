## Motivation
I created this _Portfolio Generator_ to satisfy the need to display my own projects in an easy an beautiful way. You can see my own generated portfolio here: [https://crafted.link](https://crafted.link).


## Screenshots
Here you can see four demo portfolios which were created by using this project.
